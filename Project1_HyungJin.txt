
Title: Valuation of loss and liability in resources and relationships

Investigator: HyungJin Cho

Abstract
The current study attempts to answer the two questions: is adding a liability equivalent to a loss? Is a change in relationships equivalent to a change in resources? Using the gambling task, loss and liability aversion are measured by participantsâ€™ switching point from the sure outcome to the uncertain outcome in resources and relationships. It is expected to observe that people dislike a liability more than a loss. The study expands prospect theory to a loss and liability setting in monetary and social currency and provides insights into investment decisions.
